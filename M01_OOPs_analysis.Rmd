# Search Strategy and Aggregation

The search started at the World Bank’s Microdata Library, where micro-surveys were collected from the Living Standards Measurement Surveys (LSMS) program. Data were retrieved from 80 surveys from the program which were publicly available. The surveys were filtered to only include The surveys were analyzed to include only those with two OOPs measurements—one in the consumption module, and once more in the health module. Out of the 80 initial surveys, only `r length(surveys_bothmodules$survey)` measured OOPs in both modules, which will be the sample that will be used in this work. The selected sample of surveys is exhibited in Table 1, along with information about the instruments used to capture OOPs in both modules.

The surveys went through a compilation process, where information on household's OOPs, hospitalizations, non-health consumption, and characteristics such as the household size, marital status and age of the householdhead, and rural or urban locations were collected. When available, we used aggregate consumption files provided by the surveys to estimate consumption measures. When no aggregate consumption file was available, consumption was computed by the benchmark methods detailed in Deaton and Zaidi (2002). When calculating consumption a broad definition was used, which includes food consumption, non-food consumption, imputed rent, and the cost of the use of consumer durables.

OOPs were calculated for each household on the health and consumption module. In the health module the OOPs were calculated as the sum of all health expenditures declared by each individual household member, and then adjusted to represent a 1-year recall period. The OOPs in the consumption module were calculated in similar fashion, by adding all health expenditures declared by the household in the module, and then adjusting them to a 1-year recall period. 

Despite a similar process to calculate OOPs in both modules, it is relevant to notice that each module captures OOPs in very different ways. The health module is not purposedly build to measure consumption, and OOPs are added as an extra, this results in three different styles OOPs can be captured in a health module. The first style is health care utilization, where each household member is asked whether or not they have used a specific health service in a determined amount of time. If they answer yes, a sequence of questions about the specific service ensues, including OOPs. On the other hand, if they answer no the sequence is skipped. The second style is episodic, where each household member is asked if they have suffered an illness or injury in the recent past. Similarly, if they answer yes a sequence of questions continues including OOPs. The third and least popular is the direct style, where each household member reports their expenses for a list of different health services and items. The direct style is not attached to the utilization of health services, or an episode of illness, every household member has to answer. The consumption module on the other hand is build to measure consumption, each household reports their expenses for a specified list of products, and services without a possibility of skipping questions.

# Household OOPs

With two different OOP estimates for each household for `r length(surveys_bothmodules$survey)` surveys, there is an opportunity to explore how much the reported OOPs differ by the module in the same household. Figure 1 exhibits a heatmap for each survey. OOPs in the health module are on the y-axis, while OOPs in the consumption module are on the x-axis. The color of the hexagons represents the concentration of observations around the area, with more intense tones representing a higher concentration.


It is interesting to see that some surveys do a very good job at eliciting similar OOPs between modules, such as the surveys from Uganda, and Bulgaria. On the other hand, all other surveys have a clear pattern of higher OOPs in the health module, with the exception of Ghana 2017.

Table 1 exhibits the instrument characteristics of each survey, sorting them by their regression coefficient. The coefficient was obtained by regressing the OOPs in the health module as the dependent variable, and the OOPs in the consumption module as the independent variable. A coefficient of one represents that the two modules are measuring the same underlying variable, but with some statistical noise involved. Coefficients straying away from one, on the other hand, relate to a mismatch in measuring between modules.

All surveys that have coefficients close to 1 have equal average recall periods in their consumption and health modules—pointing to the importance of using the same recall periods in order to have comparable OOPs between modules.

In our sample of surveys, the mean OOPs in the health module were higher than in the consumption module for most surveys. In fact, `r nhealth_higher` out of `r length(surveys_bothmodules$survey)` have higher mean OOPs in the health module, as can be seen in Figure 1. These are the surveys that have a share less than one, indicating that the mean OOPs in their consumption module are lower than the mean OOPs from their health module.

On average `r round(per_zero$mean_zero2[[1]]*100,1)`% and `r round(per_zero$mean_zero2[[2]]*100,1)`% of the households report zero OOPs in the consumption and health module respectively.

Figure 2 exhibits that `r nhealth_higher_zero` out of `r length(surveys_bothmodules$survey)` have higher mean OOPs in the health module than in the consumption module after excluding observations reporting zero OOPs. However, mean OOPs from the health module are still higher, and the patterns remain the same compared to Figure 1.

# Zero OOPs

Households reporting zero OOPs is a common characteristic of health care data. Many households do not spend on health care because they had no health shocks, or they could not afford treatment. On average `r round(per_zero$mean_zero2[[1]]*100,1)`% and `r round(per_zero$mean_zero2[[2]]*100,1)`% of the households report zero OOPs in the consumption and health module respectively.

As the percentage of zero OOPs differs between modules in all surveys, it will be interesting to check how concordant the answers between modules are. Across all surveys, `r round(per_concordance$both_zero2[[1]]*100,1)`% of households report zero OOPs in both modules, and `r round(per_concordance$both_pos2[[1]]*100,1)`% report positive OOPs in both. In total `r (  round(   (per_concordance$both_zero2[[1]] + per_concordance$both_pos2[[1]])*100    ,1 )    )`% of households report concordant OOPs between modules (both positive, or both negative), leaving `r 100- (  round(   (per_concordance$both_zero2[[1]] + per_concordance$both_pos2[[1]])*100    ,1 )    )`% of households that differ on their answers between modules, which is problematic from a measuring perspective.

Table 1 exhibits the concordance of household's answers between the health module and consumption module by survey. The percentages vary widely by surveys, Ghana_1991 and Ghana_2005 both have zero households reporting zero OOPs in both modules (as both of them had OOPs instruments in consumption modules administered frequently by visits throughout the year). On the other hand, the surveys from Uganda show 30%+ of households reporting zero OOPs in both modules.


Ghana_1991 has the worst non-correspondant rates, where 57.9% of households reported positive OOPs in the health or consumption module, and then reported zero on the other one. The latter discrepancy is solely driven by the zero OOPs responses in the health module, which are episodic, so in order for individuals to report OOPs they needed to report being recently ill. On the other hand, the non-concordance rate of Nigeria_2015 is entirely explained by its consumption module. The OOPs instrument happened to be a single question asking households for their total OOPs.

# Mean OOPs by Module and socio-economic status

So far, the mean OOPs from the health module have been higher than those from the consumption module. A possibility is that the socio-economic status of households drives this. Rich or poor households might report more or less OOPs in a specific module. To asses this possibility, quintiles of non-health consumption will be used as a proxy for socio-economic status. Excluding OOPs to asses, socio-economic status is essential as total consumption is not a relevant social marker for households experiencing a health shock, and they had to go through high health care expenditures because of it.

Figure 3 exhibits the mean OOPs of the consumption module over the health module, by survey and consumption quintile. We observe no clear pattern between socio-economic status and the differences in the reported OOPs between both modules.

# Catastrophic health expenditures (CHEs)

Popular datasets like the World's Bank HEFPI, and the World Development Indicators include estimations for the percentage of households incurring into a level of OOPs that is too burdensome to bear. The most popular indicators are Catastrophic health expenditures, which consist on a ratio between the OOPs of a household and its total available resources. What is troubling, is that these popular datasets publish their estimates without stating if the OOPs were coming from the health or consumption module, and without awareness of what are the possible effects of these.

We will use our sample of surveys with OOPs in a consumption and health module, and add these two estimates of OOPs to the non-health consumption of each household to come up with two different estimates of total consumption. Then, we will be able to calculate the most popular indicator of the CHE kind, 10% of total consumption, which is simply an binary variable of whether a household's OOPs exceed 10% of their total consumption.

Previously, it was evident that mean OOPs were higher for the health module in most surveys. We expect that this should make CHE rates higher using OOPs from the health module, but two factors will determine the magnitude of this difference. The first being if the difference in OOPs between modules is relevant for households with high expenditures. The second being, how significant are OOPs as a share in the total consumption of households.

In Figure 6, the CHE10% estimates using OOPs from the health module, and consumption module are exhibited. Note that there are barely any differences in the Uganda surveys, which happened to have very similar mean OOPs. Nonetheless, for other surveys, the difference can be spectacular, in Nigeria_2015 CHEs jumped from 11% to 53% by using the health module. In Nigeria_2012 from 0.3% to 6%. Overall, the pattern is clear in that OOPs using the health module are higher, with two exceptions Ghana_2017 and Ghana_1991.

# Hospitalizations

Until now, the analysis has focused on all households without regard of their health care utilization. In this regard, we should expect households who have utilized health care more to have higher OOPs, but there is no clarity on whether the health or consumption module is better at capturing OOPs for households with high utilization of health care. For 11 out of the 17 surveys in our sample, we have information on whether any household member has declared to be hospitalized.

 be to check how both modules capture the OOPs of households that we know had pressing health issues, and had to spend on health care. For ... surveys we have information on hospitalizations. We will consider that a household had an hospitalization if any household member declared to be hospitalized in the survey. We will replicate Figure 1 exhibiting the mean OOPs of the health module over the consumption module, but now splitting the samples on each survey, depending on whether the household has an hospitalization or not.
